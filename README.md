The repository is (obviously) still work in progress. 
For the parts that interface with the design files here (e.g., base and holders), check out the [Buzsaki lab github](https://github.com/buzsakilab/3d_print_designs/tree/master/Microdrives/Metal_recoverable).
There is a bit more information available at [3Dneuro.com/r2np](https://www.3dneuro.com/r2np/), which will be integrate in the repository soon.

Get in touch (contact @ 3dneuro . com) for questions and comments!
